<!--[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/leanrl.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/leanrl)  optional once published -->

A lightweight, memory-efficient, and fast Python library for extracting specific information from XBRL filings and taxonomies — **without loading the entire DTS (Discovery Tree)**.

**Funding Acknowledgment (DFG):** Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) – Collaborative Research Center (SFB/TRR) Project-ID 403041268 – _TRR 266 Accounting for Transparency_.


## Motivation

XBRL is powerful but **complex**:
- A single filing includes the instance document, company linkbases, and a huge taxonomy (hundreds of XML files)
- Traditional XBRL processors load the full DTS into memory: slow and memory-intensive
- In many real-world scenarios (data extraction, analysis, reporting), you only need a small subset of the data


**LeanRL** takes a **pragmatic, non-strict** approach:
- Process **one file at a time** (no full DTS loading)
- Extract only what you need into simple Python structures (`dict`, `list`, `pandas.DataFrame`)
- Forget strict XBRL validation and complex object models — focus on **speed and simplicity**



## Features (Planned)

<!--- Extract facts from instance documents (simple alternative to `brel`, `python-xbrl`, etc.)-->
- Parse **presentation linkbases** (build hierarchical trees, tables, roll-forwards)
- Parse **calculation linkbases** (extract summation rules)
- Parse **definition linkbases** (dimensions, tables, axes); [See: Documentation](https://github.com/reeyarn/LeanRL/tree/main/src/leanrl/linkbases/README.md)
- Parse **label linkbases** (English/translated labels)
- Parse **taxonomy schema files** (elements, types, from `elts/`, `dis/`, `stm/`)
- Convert XBRL structures to **pandas DataFrames** or **nested dictionaries**
- Support for both **company filings** and **raw US GAAP/IFRS taxonomies**

## Install
To install released version, run:
`pip install leanrl`


To install the latest development version from this github repo, run:
```shell

git clone https://github.com/reeyarn/LeanRL/
cd LeanRL
pip install -e .
```

or  `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`


## Example
```python
from leanrl import parse_label_linkbase, Roles

# Get documentation
path = "/tmp/us-gaap-2020-01-31/elts/"
#path = "LeanRL/tests/data/"

filename = "us-gaap-doc-2020-01-31.xml"

docs = parse_label_linkbase(path + filename)

for i, (concept, doc) in enumerate(docs.items()):
    print(f"{i}: {concept}: {doc}")
    if i > 32:
        break


# Get display labels
labels = parse_label_linkbase(path + 'us-gaap-lab-2020-01-31.xml', role=Roles.LABEL)


for i, (concept, label) in enumerate(labels.items()):
    print(f"{i}: {concept}: {label}")
    if i > 32:
        break
```
